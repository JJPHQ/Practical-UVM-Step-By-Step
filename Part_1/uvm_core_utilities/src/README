There were a few Minor errors in the listings in Chapter 2 during initial check in.
I have uploaded the correct sources for these files. Please update your repository.

Note that I have only provided run scripts for copy and compare. The others should be self explanatory, 
and should give you a chance to get familar with your compiler options -:)


The names of the files below are self explanatory. They should match the listings in the book.
listing_2.1.sv
listing_2.10
listing_2.10.sv
listing_2.2.sv

I could have renamed the files below. 
However, some of them are a combination of several others to make it easy to compile.  
So I chose to leave them the way they are. If you have any suggestions on how to do this cleanly, let me know and I will update GitHub.


clone.sv      -- Listing 2.6
compare_ex.sv  -- This is Listing 2.7
copy.sv        -- This is a combination of Listing 2.1, listing 2.2 and Listing 2.4.
copy_ex.sv     -- This  is Listing 2.5 with Listing 2.1 and Listing 2.2 so that it can be run..
copy_obj.sv    --- This  is Listing 2.5 with Listing 2.1 and Listing 2.2 so that it can be run..
new_packer.sv  -- Listing 2.11
compare2.sv    -- This is a complete example for the compare operation
print.sv -- Listing 2.9
completed_class.sv   -- Listing 2.12

If you see any problems, I would appreciate a quick note so that I can fix it. The database is now over 7K files, and 
Any bugs are most likely are a result of copy-paste/move errors that I may have made inadverdently.

Thank you
